Test Assignment: Todo List Application

Objective: Create a simple todo list application using React and TypeScript. The application should fetch initial tasks from an API, allow users to mark tasks as completed, and add new tasks to the UI.

Requirements:

Fetch Initial Tasks:
Use the following API to fetch the initial list of tasks: https://dummyjson.com/todos.
Display the fetched tasks in a list format.
Mark Task as Completed:
Implement functionality to mark a task as completed by clicking a "Complete" button next to each task.
When a task is marked as completed, visually indicate this change (e.g., by striking through the task text).
No backend request is needed to update the task status.
Add New Task:
Provide an input field and a button to add a new task.
When a new task is added, it should appear in the list of tasks.
No backend request is needed to add the new task.
Guidelines:

Use React and TypeScript for the implementation.
Style the application using CSS to make it visually appealing.
Ensure the code is clean, well-organized, and follows best practices (Unit test, etc)
Bonus (Optional):

Implement local storage to persist the tasks between page reloads.
Add a feature to delete tasks from the list.
Use CSS-in-JS library to create reusable and extendable UI components.
